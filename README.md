# Exercise 7: Quantitative thermochronology, part II

This exercise is part 2 of the exercises on thermochronology. In this exercise you will modify this week's notebook to load [a data file of measured thermochronometer ages](data/Bhutan_age_data.txt), compare the measured ages to predicted ages from your Python code using a goodness-of-fit equation, and plot the results. The goal is to try to minimize the misfit between the predicted and measured thermochronometer ages, and quantify the long-term exhumation rates in the Bhutan Himalaya from different thermochronometers.

## Overview

This two-part set of exercises is designed to give you a better understanding of thermochronology and the temperature field in the Earth's crust. Thermochronology combines many aspects of what we have studied in this course, including the advection and diffusion equations, erosional processes, and some basic geostatistics. This first part of the exercises on thermochronology is intended to provide an understanding of heat advection and diffusion in the Earth's crust, the time-dependence of thermal processes, and how the thermal history recorded in our "digital rock" can be used to predict thermochronometer ages.
